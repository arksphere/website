## Introduction

SGLang is a high-performance inference and serving framework for large language models and vision language models. It supports multimodal models, extreme concurrency, and flexible frontend programming, widely adopted in enterprise production environments.

## Key Features

- Efficient backend inference with RadixAttention, zero-overhead scheduling, distributed parallelism
- Flexible frontend language for chained generation, control flow, multimodal input, and external interaction
- Supports mainstream LLMs, embedding models, and reward models, easily extensible
- Active open-source community, widely adopted in industry

## Use Cases

- Enterprise-scale LLM/VLM inference and deployment
- Multimodal AI application development
- High-concurrency production inference
- Rapid prototyping and integration for LLM applications

## Technical Highlights

- Python/Rust/C++/CUDA multi-language collaboration, extreme performance optimization
- Supports GPU/CPU hybrid inference and distributed deployment
- Built-in quantization, caching, structured output, and other advanced features
