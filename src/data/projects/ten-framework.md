## Overview

TEN Framework is an open-source ecosystem for building real-time, multimodal conversational agents, including voice, vision and avatar interactions. It offers runtime components, agent examples, voice activity detection, transcription, and deployment guides to help teams ship low-latency, production-ready conversational applications.

## Key features

- Ready-made agent examples (real-time voice assistant, lip-sync avatars, SIP call integration) to accelerate development.
- Multimodal capabilities with low-latency audio pipelines and extensible modules.
- Modular architecture and multilingual documentation for easy deployment and extension.

## Use cases

- Real-time voice assistants and customer-facing conversational agents requiring low latency.
- Embedded or edge device voice interaction (example: ESP32-S3 integrations).
- Media and entertainment scenarios such as lip-sync avatars and interactive experiences.

## Technical highlights

- Hybrid language stack (C, Python, TypeScript, Rust) suitable for diverse runtime environments.
- Modular runtime with plugin-style middleware for audio processing, model integration, and third-party services.
- Active community and permissive open-source stance for reuse and contribution.
