## Overview

Eino is a Go-first framework for developing LLM applications, offering rich component abstractions (ChatModel, Tool, Retriever, Workflow) and powerful orchestration primitives (Chain, Graph, Workflow). The framework emphasizes stream processing, type safety, concurrency management, and extensible callback mechanisms to enable production-grade, observable AI services.

## Key Features

- Rich components and abstractions for reuse and composition
- Powerful graph/chain/workflow orchestration with stream handling and branching
- Extensive examples, documentation, and developer tooling for production adoption
- Built-in observability and debugging hooks for tracing and metrics
- Multi-model provider support with tool calling and RAG workflows

## Use Cases

Suitable for integrating LLM capabilities into backend services or microservice architectures, such as knowledge QA, document retrieval, automation workflows, conversational assistants, and multi-step task orchestration. Eino fits projects that demand high concurrency, strong typing, and production reliability.

## Technical Highlights

Implemented in Go, Eino benefits from type safety, performance, and concurrency primitives. The framework provides stream composition, aspect-oriented callbacks, and example-driven recipes to accelerate building robust LLM applications while maintaining flexibility.
