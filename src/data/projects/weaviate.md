## Introduction

Weaviate is an open-source, cloud-native vector database that stores both objects and vectors, combining semantic search, keyword filtering, and high availability for large-scale AI applications.

## Key Features

- Automatic vectorization or import of pre-computed embeddings
- Combines vector search and keyword filtering in a single query interface
- Enterprise features: multi-tenancy, replication, RBAC authorization
- Cloud-native architecture with fault tolerance and scalability

## Use Cases

- RAG systems and intelligent Q&A
- Semantic and image search
- Recommendation engines and content classification
- Chatbots and knowledge bases

## Technical Highlights

- Supports multiple embedding models (OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, etc.)
- Direct import or automatic generation of vectors
- Multi-language clients and API support
- Active community and continuous development
