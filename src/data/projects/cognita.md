## Overview

Cognita is an open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework by TrueFoundry designed for production use. It helps developers modularize retrieval, indexing, and generation components and integrate them into applications quickly. Cognita supports multiple vector stores and retrieval backends and provides extensible pipelines and toolchains for building reliable knowledge-driven generation systems in real-world scenarios.

## Key Features

- Modular RAG pipelines with pluggable retrievers, re-rankers, and generators.
- Compatibility with multiple vector databases and indexing backends for easy switching.
- Production-focused deployment and observability features, enabling CI/CD integration.
- Extensible plugin architecture for team collaboration and long-term maintenance.

## Use Cases

- Enterprise knowledge-base Q&A and document assistants that leverage proprietary data for tailored responses.
- Search-augmented customer support and assistant systems that improve answer accuracy and explainability.
- Centralized platforms that manage vector indexes, data pipelines, and model inference for production workloads.

## Technical Highlights

- Implemented in Python following modern engineering practices for easy ML workflow integration.
- Supports multi-source data ingestion, preprocessing, and vectorization with flexible configuration.
- Emphasizes observability and maintainability, integrating with common monitoring and logging systems for production troubleshooting and performance tuning.
