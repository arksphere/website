Keras 3 is a multi-backend deep learning framework, with support for JAX, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenVINO (for inference-only). Effortlessly build and train models for computer vision, natural language processing, audio processing, timeseries forecasting, recommender systems, etc.

- **Accelerated model development**: Ship deep learning solutions faster thanks to the high-level UX of Keras and the availability of easy-to-debug runtimes like PyTorch or JAX eager execution.
- **State-of-the-art performance**: By picking the backend that is the fastest for your model architecture (often JAX!), leverage speedups ranging from 20% to 350% compared to other frameworks. [Benchmark here](https://keras.io/getting_started/benchmarks/).
- **Datacenter-scale training**: Scale confidently from your laptop to large clusters of GPUs or TPUs.
