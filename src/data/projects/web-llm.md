## Overview

WebLLM is a high-performance in-browser language model inference engine that uses WebGPU to run LLM inference directly in web browsers without server-side processing, enabling privacy-preserving deployments and low-latency experiences.

## Key Features

- In-browser inference with WebGPU acceleration.
- OpenAI API compatibility with streaming, JSON-mode, and experimental function calling support.
- Support for multiple prebuilt models and easy custom model integration.

## Use Cases

- Privacy-focused chat assistants and browser-based AI tools.
- Reducing backend costs and latency by moving inference to the client.
- Education, demos, and rapid prototyping using CDN or npm integration.

## Technical Highlights

- WebAssembly + WebGPU for efficient inference and streaming generation.
- WebWorker/ServiceWorker support for offloading computation and keeping UI responsive.
- Modular NPM/ CDN usage with extensive examples for quick integration.
