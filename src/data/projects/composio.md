## Introduction

Composio provides SDKs and a platform to enable agentic applications and tool calling. It includes TypeScript and Python SDKs, a tool router, and MCP-based services such as Rube that connect LLMs and agents to 500+ apps (Gmail, Slack, Notion, etc.).

## Key features

- Official TypeScript and Python SDKs with modern packaging (npm/pnpm, pip, poetry).
- Tool routing and provider integrations, supporting toolkits and discovery for agent workflows.
- MCP support and integrations (Rube) to enable consistent integrations across multiple AI clients.

## Use cases

- Integrating external tools and APIs into agent applications (email, calendar, file systems).
- Building multi-client agent platforms or plugins (VS Code, desktop clients).
- Connecting enterprise services to AI workflows for automation and collaboration.

## Technical highlights

- Multi-language SDKs (TypeScript/Node, Python) for production and browser/server environments.
- OpenAPI specifications and comprehensive documentation to generate client code and tests.
- MIT license and an active community with extensive examples and integration tests.
