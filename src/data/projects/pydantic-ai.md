Pydantic AI is a framework developed by the Pydantic and FastAPI teams aimed at building the next generation of structured, production-grade AI systems. It integrates Pydantic's data validation strengths with modern AI development needs to provide a developer-friendly platform for building robust AI applications.

## Python-native control flow

The framework leverages Python's native control flow and asynchronous features so developers can use familiar Python syntax to build complex AI applications without learning a new DSL or configuration language.

## Strict data validation

Pydantic AI uses Pydantic models to validate LLM outputs and ensure generated data conforms to expected structures and types. This greatly improves system reliability and reduces runtime errors caused by malformed model outputs.
