## Detailed Introduction

OneFlow is a deep learning framework focused on scalable training and efficient distributed execution. It provides a simple programming model and high-performance runtime for large-scale training scenarios, targeting both research and production use cases.

## Main Features

- Efficient distributed training scheduling and communication optimizations.
- Modular operator support and custom operator extensibility.
- Production-ready pipeline and model parallelism solutions.
- Tooling for operator optimization and deployment examples.

## Use Cases

OneFlow fits large-scale model training, distributed clusters, model-parallel training, and enterprise-grade training pipelines, used by research labs and AI platforms requiring robust engineering support.

## Technical Features

The framework optimizes scheduling, memory management and communication layers, supports CUDA backends and integrates with common toolchains to ease migration from prototypes to production.
