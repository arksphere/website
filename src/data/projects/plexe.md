## Detailed Introduction

Plexe enables developers and product teams to build, train, and deploy machine learning models using plain-language prompts. By describing the model intent and example inputs/outputs, Plexe automates data preprocessing, model construction, evaluation, and packaging. It offers both an open-source library for local integration and a managed console for enterprise deployment.

## Main Features

- Define model intent and schemas using natural language, lowering the barrier to model creation.
- Multi-agent architecture coordinates analysis, code generation, testing, and optimization.
- Support for multiple providers and runtimes (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ray for distributed training).
- Model saving, export, and reproducible training pipelines for production deployment.

## Use Cases

Plexe is suitable for converting business problems into deployable models quickly, such as churn prediction, fraud detection, recommendation prototypes, and domain-specific analytics. Teams that prefer self-hosting can use the open-source library; teams wanting a managed experience can use Plexe’s cloud console.

## Technical Features

- Automatic schema inference and generation of training pipelines from natural language descriptions.
- Integration with large language models (LLM, Large Language Model) for code generation and model design assistance.
- Implements Model Context Protocol (MCP, Model Context Protocol) for coordination and orchestration between agents.
- Works with distributed frameworks like Ray to speed up model search and parallel training.
