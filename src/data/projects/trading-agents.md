## Detailed Introduction

TradingAgents is a multi-agent framework aimed at financial trading, combining large language model-driven strategies with simulation and backtesting tools. The project provides multi-agent coordination, environment wrapping, and evaluation utilities to help researchers validate LLM-based strategies and agent collaboration mechanisms in simulated markets.

## Main Features

- Multi-agent support: run parallel agents to study cooperative or adversarial behaviors.
- Environment & backtesting: integrated backtest tools and simulation environments for performance and risk evaluation.
- LLM-driven strategies: leverage large language models for strategy generation, signal extraction, and decision modeling.
- Open-source license: Apache-2.0 for reproducible research and engineering.

## Use Cases

- Strategy research: test and optimize LLM-based trading strategies in simulated settings.
- Risk evaluation: backtest strategies across market regimes to assess robustness.
- Agent collaboration research: explore multi-agent coordination and game-theoretic interactions in trading tasks.

## Technical Characteristics

- Provides customizable environment interfaces and evaluation pipelines for automated experiments and benchmarks.
- Supports multiple model backends and concurrent execution to accommodate large-scale simulation needs.
- License: Apache-2.0, suitable for both academic and commercial use.
