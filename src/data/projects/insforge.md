## Overview

InsForge is an agent-native backend platform positioned as a Supabase alternative. It exposes features such as authentication, database, storage, and serverless functions in an AI-manageable way, enabling AI agents to build, operate, and extend full-stack applications. The project provides documentation, examples, and quickstart flows to get started with Docker and connect AI agents.

## Key Features

- Full authentication and user management for access control and multi-tenant use cases.
- Database and storage services with APIs for structured data and file handling.
- Serverless functions and extensible backend to support agent-driven workflows.
- AI-native integrations: MCP-compatible adapters and examples for connecting agents like Claude or GPT.

## Use Cases

- Rapidly provision AI-managed backends for prototypes or production applications.
- Educational demos and prototypes demonstrating AI-assisted full-stack development.
- Internal or cloud deployments where agents orchestrate backend resources programmatically.

## Technical Highlights

- Frontend: React + TypeScript dashboard and example applications.
- Backend: Modular services with Docker-first deployment and cloud-native patterns.
- Docs & examples: Official documentation site and Docker quickstart for local testing.
