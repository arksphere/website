## Overview

Trigger.dev is an open-source platform for building AI agents and long-running workflows. It provides durable tasks without timeouts, retries, queues, observability, and elastic scaling to run complex production workloads reliably.

## Key Features

- Long-running tasks: execute jobs without timeouts, checkpointing and retries for durability.
- Observability: full tracing, logs, and real-time streaming for debugging and monitoring.
- SDKs and extensibility: TypeScript/JavaScript SDKs, build extensions, and frontend integration hooks.

## Use Cases

- Deploy LLM-driven agents as production services handling complex, multi-step workflows.
- Replace short-lived serverless functions when durability, retries, and idempotency are required.
- Self-host or use cloud offering to iterate quickly and scale background workloads.

## Technical Characteristics

- TypeScript-first runtime with extension points and resource configuration for CPU/RAM.
- Real-time streaming support, concurrency controls, and task versioning for safe rollouts.
- Apache-2.0 license, active community, and comprehensive documentation.
