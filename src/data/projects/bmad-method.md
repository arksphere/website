## Overview

BMAD-METHOD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI Driven Development) is an Agile, AI-focused development framework that eliminates context loss between planning and implementation by defining specialized agent roles (Analyst, PM, Dev, etc.) and context-engineered development. The project provides a closed-loop process from planning and requirements to implementation, including command sets, expansion packs, and integrations to help teams industrialize AI capabilities.

## Key Features

- Role-based agents and planning pipeline: Built-in agent roles collaborate to produce PRDs, architecture, and implementation-ready documents, reducing gaps between design and execution.
- Context-engineered development: Embeds complete context into story files so execution agents have all details required to implement features.
- Expansion packs and multi-platform support: Offers expansion packs to adapt to domains and distributes via npm, PyPI, etc.
- Documentation and community: Comprehensive guides, architecture docs, and active community presence (Discord, YouTube, multilingual READMEs).

## Use Cases

Suitable for organizations that want to integrate AI capabilities into engineering practices: automated product planning and requirement generation, building domain-specific collaborative agents, preserving context continuity across large projects, and teaching/research on agent collaboration workflows.

## Technical Highlights

- Configuration-driven and modular: Compose capabilities via configuration and expansion packs for easy customization and evolution.
- Story-first delivery: Write complete implementation context into story files so automation agents can seamlessly take over.
- Community-driven iteration: Active open-source development with frequent releases and community contributions.
