## Introduction

LitGPT is a high-performance LLM toolkit maintained by Lightning AI that implements 20+ models from-scratch and provides standardized recipes and workflows for pretraining, finetuning, evaluation, and deployment. It targets both research and production use cases.

## Key Features

- End-to-end YAML recipes and workflow orchestration for training and deployment.
- Support for Flash Attention, FSDP, LoRA/QLoRA, quantization, and multi-GPU/TPU setups.
- Optimized examples for low-memory GPUs and large-scale distributed training.

## Use Cases

- Researchers reproducing and benchmarking model implementations and experiments.
- Engineers deploying finetuned models in production with performance and cost optimizations.
- Educators and learners using clear recipes to teach LLM training and evaluation.

## Technical Highlights

- Minimal, single-file implementations for easy debugging and extensibility.
- A comprehensive config hub for validated training settings and recipes.
- Apache-2.0 licensed with an active community and extensive tutorials.
