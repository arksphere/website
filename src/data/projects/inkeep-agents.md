## Overview

Inkeep Agents is an engineering-focused platform combining a no-code visual builder and a TypeScript SDK to rapidly create, debug and deploy multi-agent workflows. The platform supports full two-way sync between visual and code editors, built-in task orchestration, state management and event triggers, lowering the barrier to develop multi-step automated workflows. Documentation and SDK guides make it easy to integrate in enterprise or self-hosted environments.

## Key Features

- No-code visual builder: define agent behavior and flows with drag-and-drop components.
- TypeScript SDK: programmatic extension and custom logic for production use.
- Two-way sync: visual editor and code editor remain in sync as mutable sources of truth.

## Use Cases

- Rapid prototyping and building generative agent applications.
- Multi-agent business automation (customer support, process automation, data workflows).
- Enterprise self-hosted deployments integrated with existing tooling and data sources.

## Technical Highlights

- TypeScript-based SDK and plugin architecture for front-end/back-end unified development.
- Task orchestration, event-driven triggers and persistence for observable, recoverable workflows.
- Comprehensive documentation and examples; extensible via plugins for data/tool integrations.
