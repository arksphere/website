## Detailed Introduction

RapidFire AI is a toolkit focused on rapid experimentation and customization of large language models (LLMs). It brings together experiment tracking, fine-tuning and post-training workflows into reproducible pipelines, shortening the loop from model modification to deployable outcomes and making comparisons and rollbacks straightforward.

## Main Features

- Rapid experimentation: lightweight pipelines to simplify fine-tuning and post-training tasks.
- Experiment tracking: logs configurations, metrics, and model snapshots for reproducibility.
- Multi-model and post-processing support: compatible with various LLM architectures and common fine-tuning techniques.
- Open-source and extensible: published as OSS to facilitate custom evaluators and data connectors.

## Use Cases

Suitable for research and engineering teams performing model fine-tuning, prompt experiments, small-data post-training, and model comparisons. RapidFire accelerates iteration when validating custom datasets and tuning strategies.

## Technical Characteristics

The project uses declarative configuration and a pluggable component design, integrating experiment tracking and model management modules. It supports GPU acceleration and common ML infra (for example MLflow or custom storage backends). For more details see the official site: [RapidFire AI](https://rapidfire.ai) and the GitHub repository.
