Motia is an innovative backend framework designed for modern AI services and complex business workflows. It unifies API management, backend job handling, event flows and agent orchestration into a graceful framework inspired by frontend developer ergonomics.

## Modular "Step" architecture

Motia uses a unique "Step" concept that packages each function into a reusable component. This modular design allows developers to compose complex backend systems like building blocks, improving maintainability and reusability.

## Multi-language runtime support

The framework natively supports Python, TypeScript and Ruby runtimes, enabling teams with diverse technology stacks to onboard quickly and leverage each language's strengths.
