## Overview

Beta9 is the open-source engine behind Beam, offering ultrafast serverless GPU inference, isolated sandboxes, and background job execution. It supports high concurrency, rapid container startup, and heterogeneous hardware environments, and can be self-hosted or used via Beam's managed platform.

## Key Features

- Serverless inference with scale-to-zero autoscaling and autoscaling policies.
- Fast container runtime enabling sub-second container startup for low-latency tasks.
- GPU and heterogeneous hardware support with parallelization and scheduling features.

## Use Cases

- Low-latency online model serving and intelligent agents.
- Large-scale parallel workloads such as batch fine-tuning and data pipelines.
- Integrating self-hosted clusters with Beam Cloud for managed deployment options.

## Technical Details

- Provides Go core and Python SDK for developer workflows and API integration.
- Uses Bazel/Makefile-based build tooling with extensive examples and documentation (<https://docs.beam.cloud/>).
- Designed for distributed scheduling, persistence volumes, and high-throughput task queues.
