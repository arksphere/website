## Detailed Introduction

Blinko is an open-source, self-hosted AI-powered card note application that emphasizes privacy and data ownership. It combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs) to enable natural language search, generation, and organization of notes while keeping user data under the user's control. Blinko provides a demo site and options for local or Docker-based deployment.

## Main Features

- AI-enhanced note retrieval and augmentation with natural language queries.
- Data ownership and privacy: configuration and storage can be self-hosted.
- Lightweight cross-platform support via Tauri for macOS, Windows, Linux and mobile.
- Open-source collaboration with documentation, an online demo and contribution guides.

## Use Cases

Suitable for individuals and teams who want to capture fleeting ideas, manage drafts, archive meeting notes, and access content via semantic search. Blinko can serve as a personal knowledge base, a writing draft manager, or a privacy-first backend integrated into RAG workflows.

## Technical Features

- Model compatibility: integrates with OpenAI, Anthropic and other providers for retrieval and generation.
- Storage and indexing: stores plain Markdown and builds semantic indexes for fast queries.
- Easy deployment: provides Docker scripts and local development instructions.
- Modern stack: built on Next.js, React and Tauri for a responsive local-first experience.
