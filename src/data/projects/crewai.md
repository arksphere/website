## Introduction

CrewAI is an open-source, Python-centric multi-agent orchestration framework designed for minimal overhead, high performance, and highly customizable autonomous agent systems. It combines “Crews” (collaborative multi-agent teams) and “Flows” (event-driven workflows), enabling both agent collaboration and fine-grained control over execution paths. CrewAI is suitable for everything from rapid prototyping to enterprise-grade production environments.

## Key Features

- High performance and lightweight implementation, independent of frameworks like LangChain.
- Crews: Role-based agent collaboration for clear division of labor and responsibilities.
- Flows: Event-driven, composable workflow control supporting conditional branching and stateful execution.
- Rich tool and integration options: Connects to OpenAI, Ollama, local models, and supports custom tools and external APIs.
- Comprehensive examples and tutorials: Includes project templates, configuration samples, and community course resources for easy onboarding and production deployment.

## Use Cases

- Automated research and data collection: Parallel information gathering and aggregation using specialized agents.
- Business process automation: Orchestrate complex approval, reporting, or data processing workflows as repeatable Flows.
- Collaborative content generation: Multi-agent teams for drafting, reviewing, and formatting documents or reports.
- Production-grade agent services: Build reliable, observable systems in enterprise environments using Crews + Flows.

## Technical Highlights

- Native Python implementation (compatible with Python 3.10+), modular design for low-level customization.
- Supports sequential and parallel execution models, with advanced tracing and observability features.
- Configuration-first development: Define agents, tasks, and flows via YAML for version control and reproducibility.
- Rich ecosystem examples: Official demos, community tutorials, and videos for quick onboarding and extensibility.
