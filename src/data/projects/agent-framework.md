- Built-in observability (OpenTelemetry), middleware system, and a DevUI for development and debugging.

## Use Cases

- Orchestrating collaborative multi-agent automation pipelines in production.
- Rapid prototyping and debugging of agent strategies and complex data flows during development.
- Unifying access to multiple LLM providers and deploying/monitoring agents at scale.

## Technical Highlights

- Modular package layout with experimental AF Labs extensions.
- Integrations with Azure OpenAI and comprehensive tutorials, quickstarts, and migration guides.
- MIT-licensed open source project with an active contributor community, suitable for enterprise integration.
