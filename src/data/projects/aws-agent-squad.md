AWS Agent Squad (originally Multi-Agent Orchestrator) is a multi-agent orchestration framework from AWS tailored for enterprise applications. With strong GitHub traction and robust multi-agent management features, it can handle complex conversational scenarios and collaborative agent tasks.

## Enterprise reliability

Designed as an AWS-first framework, Agent Squad considers enterprise-grade requirements from the start. It supports local, AWS Lambda, and multi-cloud deployments, providing high availability and scalability for production scenarios.

## Intent classification and routing

The framework includes advanced intent classification and routing systems that analyze queries and route them to the most suitable agents. This improves response correctness and optimizes compute resource allocation for stable production operation.

## Multi-agent trace and memory management

Agent Squad provides complete multi-agent trace and memory management, supporting both context persistence and cross-agent information sharing. Agents can maintain coherent conversational history, enabling collaborative problem solving for complex customer service or technical support scenarios.

## Flexible response patterns

The framework supports both flow-based and event-driven response patterns, allowing developers to choose interaction styles that best fit their use cases—real-time chat or large-scale asynchronous backend processing.
