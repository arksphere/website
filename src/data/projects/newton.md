## Overview

Newton is a GPU-accelerated physics simulation engine built on NVIDIA Warp, designed for robotics and simulation researchers. It emphasizes differentiable simulation, OpenUSD support, and extensibility for large-scale experiments and rapid iteration.

## Key Features

- GPU-optimized physics kernels with examples for robots, cloth, MPM and more.
- Integration with MuJoCo Warp as a high-performance backend and a rich example set.
- Support for USD output, differentiable simulation and multi-device execution.

## Use Cases

- Rapid prototyping and performance testing for robotic control and simulation research.
- Large-scale material and cloth modeling, inverse kinematics and dynamics evaluation.
- Research and engineering workflows that require GPU acceleration and differentiability.

## Technical Highlights

- Built on NVIDIA Warp with a Python API and example-driven execution using uv.
- Comprehensive documentation, numerous examples and an active community; Apache-2.0 licensed.
- Configurable environments and examples via uv tooling.
