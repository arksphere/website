FastGPT is an open-source intelligent knowledge base and AI application building platform developed by the Labring team, designed for rapid development and deployment of AI applications. Built on Large Language Model (LLM) technology, the platform provides a complete suite of out-of-the-box capabilities including intelligent data processing, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) search engine, and visual AI workflow orchestration. These core features enable developers to easily build and deploy professional-grade intelligent Q&A systems and knowledge base applications without deep knowledge of complex AI technical details.

## Core Features

FastGPT offers rich functional modules covering the complete process from data import to application deployment. The platform supports multiple data source integrations, including document uploads, web crawling, API connections, and features built-in intelligent text segmentation and vectorization processing capabilities. Through a visual workflow orchestration interface, users can design AI application business logic like building blocks, including multi-turn dialogues, conditional branches, external API calls, and other complex scenarios. The platform also provides comprehensive permission management and multi-tenant support, suitable for team collaboration and enterprise-level application deployment.

## Technical Highlights

FastGPT adopts a modular architecture design that supports flexible model switching and extension. The platform is compatible with mainstream large language models, including GPT series, Claude, Wenxin Yiyan, Tongyi Qianwen, and others, allowing users to freely choose based on cost and performance requirements. The built-in vector database supports efficient semantic search, enabling fast responses even with massive knowledge bases. Additionally, FastGPT provides rich debugging tools and performance monitoring features to help developers continuously optimize application effectiveness.

## Use Cases

FastGPT is widely used in enterprise knowledge bases, intelligent customer service, document Q&A, education and training, and many other fields. By importing enterprise internal documents, product manuals, technical documentation, and other materials into the platform, users can quickly build an intelligent assistant to provide 7×24 hour knowledge query services for employees or customers. The platform's multimodal support and workflow orchestration capabilities enable it to handle not only simple Q&A tasks but also complex business process automation scenarios.
