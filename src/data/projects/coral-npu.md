## Detailed Introduction

Coral NPU is a machine learning accelerator core provided by Google Coral, designed for energy-efficient inference on edge devices. The project emphasizes co-optimized hardware architecture and software stack to deliver real-time or near-real-time inference under constrained power and compute budgets. The open-source repository includes tooling related to the architecture, runtime support, and examples, enabling developers to port models and run them on edge hardware.

## Main Features

- Edge-oriented: optimized for energy efficiency on battery-powered and embedded devices.
- Efficient inference: specialized operators and hardware acceleration improve throughput and latency.
- Open-source license: released under Apache-2.0, suitable for industry and research use.
- Developer-friendly: provides SDKs, drivers, and examples for quick onboarding and deployment.

## Use Cases

- Local inference for edge AI agents, such as home and industrial sensors.
- Low-latency visual inference, e.g., object detection and face recognition.
- Offline speech recognition and natural interaction to reduce cloud dependency.
- Industrial IoT and on-site device intelligence upgrades.

## Technical Features

- Hardware-software co-design: instruction-level optimizations and runtime support for specific operators.
- Compatible toolchain: model conversion, quantization, and deployment tools for edge targets.
- Support for model compression and quantization strategies to lower memory and compute footprint.
- Community maintenance and documentation: official developer guides and repository contributions are actively maintained.
