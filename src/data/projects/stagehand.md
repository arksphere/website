Stagehand is an innovative AI browser automation framework designed for production-grade automation tasks.

## Background

Existing browser automation tools typically fall into two categories: low-level code-based solutions (such as Selenium, Playwright, Puppeteer) and high-level AI agents, which are easy to use but lack control in production. Stagehand combines the strengths of both, allowing developers to flexibly choose between code and natural language to describe automation workflows.

## Core Capabilities

- **Hybrid orchestration with code and natural language**: Choose Playwright code or AI instructions based on your familiarity with the page.
- **AI-powered page navigation**: Use AI to automatically explore and operate unfamiliar pages.
- **Action preview and caching**: Preview AI actions, cache repeated operations to save time and tokens.
- **One-line integration of SOTA models**: Integrate the latest models from OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. into browser automation workflows with a single line of code.

## Use Cases

- Automating complex web page operations
- Intelligent form filling and data collection
- Cross-platform automated testing
- Smart office workflows powered by AI
