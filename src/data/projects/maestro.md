## Overview

Maestro streamlines fine-tuning for multimodal vision-language models. It provides reusable recipes, a consistent JSONL data format, and CLI/Python interfaces to reduce boilerplate and improve reproducibility.

## Key features

- Ready-to-use training recipes for Florence-2, PaliGemma 2, and Qwen2.5-VL.
- Support for LoRA / QLoRA and graph-freezing optimizations to lower resource requirements.
- CLI and Python APIs with Colab cookbooks for quick experimentation.

## Use cases

- Fine-tuning VLMs for detection, JSON extraction, and captioning tasks.
- Reproducible experimentation in research and teaching.
- Resource-efficient adaptation in constrained environments.

## Technical notes

- Compatible with major VLM backbones and provides cookbooks/Colab notebooks to reproduce experiments quickly.
