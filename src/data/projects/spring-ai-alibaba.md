Spring AI Alibaba is an agentic AI framework tailored for Java developers. It helps teams build chatbots, workflows, and multi-agent applications quickly. The project features a Graph-based orchestration engine, abundant built-in nodes, integrations for retrieval and tool usage (RAG, MCP), and enterprise-grade adapters for cloud services.

## Key Features

- Graph-based multi-agent orchestration with support for nested and parallel flows.
- Deep integration with Alibaba Cloud ecosystem (Bailian, ARMS, Nacos MCP) to ease production deployments.
- Support for Plan-Act agent patterns and a set of tools like search, web crawling and a Python execution environment.
- Official Playground and example repositories for quick start and demonstration.

## Use Cases

- Enterprise assistants and automated workflows.
- RAG and model service integrations with Alibaba Cloud.
- Java/Spring developer teams building production agent platforms.

## Technical Notes

- Primary language: Java, with TypeScript/JS for frontend components.
- Provides starter modules (dashscope, nl2sql, nacos-mcp client, etc.).
- Supports streaming outputs, state snapshots, human-in-the-loop, and telemetry hooks.
