## Overview

mistral.rs is a Rust-native inference library focused on running Mistral family models with low latency and minimal resource usage, targeting embedded and server-side light deployments.

## Key features

- Native Rust implementation with memory and concurrency safety.
- Support for common inference optimizations and quantization.
- Easy to embed into desktop or lightweight server deployments.

## Use cases

- Edge devices and resource-constrained inference services.
- Applications that require integration with the Rust ecosystem.

## Technical highlights

- Leverages Rust ownership and concurrency primitives for efficient memory management.
- Extensible backend adapter layer to integrate with various hardware accelerators.
