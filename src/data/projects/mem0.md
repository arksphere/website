## Overview

Mem0 ("mem-zero") is a memory layer designed for AI assistants and agents. It enables hierarchical memory management and efficient retrieval to support personalized, long-term interactions.

## Key features

- Multi-level memory: supports user-, session-, and agent-level memories with adaptive personalization.
- Cost-efficient long-term memory: reduces context cost using retrieval and summarization strategies to lower token consumption and latency.
- Developer-friendly: cross-platform SDKs (Python/TypeScript), hosted and self-hosted options, and integrations with common vector backends.

## Use cases

- Personalized chat assistants that retain user preferences and long-term context.
- Customer support systems that recall historical tickets and user interactions.
- Multi-modal agents that require persistent state across long-running tasks.

## Technical notes

- Supports multiple vector stores and flexible retrieval/indexing strategies; offers managed platform features and an open-source SDK with demos and documentation (OpenMemory integration).
