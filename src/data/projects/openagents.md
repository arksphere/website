## Overview

OpenAgents is an open-source platform that enables developers and researchers to deploy, connect, and manage networks of autonomous AI agents. It features a modular architecture with plugin (mod) support and is protocol-agnostic, allowing integration with popular LLM providers and varied transport layers to simplify building collaborative multi-agent systems.

## Key Features

- Quick network and Studio launch to create interactive agent communities.
- Protocol-agnostic networking (WebSocket, gRPC, HTTP, libp2p) for flexible deployments.
- Mod-driven extensibility for shared documents, collaborative workflows, and interactive experiences.
- Support for hybrid model usage combining cloud LLMs and local runtimes for flexible cost/performance trade-offs.

## Use Cases

- Research on multi-agent collaboration, task decomposition, and emergent behaviors.
- Rapid prototyping of agent-based applications for document collaboration, retrieval-augmented assistants, or community bots.
- Integration layer for assembling multi-model capabilities and sharing agent behaviours across a community.

## Technical Characteristics

- Event-driven architecture for reliable message delivery and scalable coordination between agents.
- Provides a Python SDK and Studio frontend, with deployment options via Docker or PyPI packages.
- Designed to interoperate with different model providers and inference backends to balance latency, throughput, and cost.
