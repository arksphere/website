## Overview

LlamaFarm is an open-source platform that helps developers deploy AI models, agents, vector databases, and RAG pipelines locally or remotely within minutes. It combines model management, inference services, and retrieval components to simplify model rollout and iteration.

## Key Features

- One-click deployment for a variety of open-source and private models, including popular LLMs.
- Integrated vector storage and retrieval components for building RAG workflows.
- Reusable deployment templates and CI/CD integration for faster dev-to-production cycles.

## Use Cases

- Rapid local or edge deployment for development and debugging of inference and RAG services.
- Composing multiple models and retrieval components into repeatable production pipelines.
- MLOps scenarios that require unified management of models, agents, and inference services.

## Technical Highlights

- Containerized deployment templates with support for both local and remote environments.
- Compatibility with mainstream open-source models and data stores for easy extensibility.
- Automation-friendly design suitable for integration with CI/CD and monitoring systems.
