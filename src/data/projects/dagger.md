## Introduction

Dagger is an open-source runtime for composable workflows. It lets developers treat containers, files, repositories, and more as programmable, cacheable objects and compose them into reproducible workflows using Go, Python, or TypeScript. Dagger is well-suited for CI/CD, platform automation, and AI agentic workflows.

## Key Features

- Containerized workflow execution with automatic caching
- Universal type system for cross-language components and modules
- Built-in observability: tracing, logs, and metrics for debugging
- Native LLM/agent augmentation features to build agentic workflows

## Use Cases

- Reproducible CI/CD pipelines that run locally or in CI
- Providing constrained, observable runtime environments for AI agents
- Rapid prototyping and debugging of complex automation flows

## Technical Highlights

- Multi-language SDKs and CLI (Go, Python, TypeScript)
- Cacheable immutable artifacts to speed up builds and reduce cost
- Extensible module ecosystem (Daggerverse) for sharing reusable components
