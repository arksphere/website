## Introduction

Daytona provides secure and elastic infrastructure for running AI-generated code. It offers fast isolated sandboxes, programmatic control via Python and TypeScript SDKs, and support for persistence and concurrent workflows, enabling safe execution of model-generated code in production and research environments.

## Key features

- Sub-90ms sandbox creation for interactive flows.
- Isolated runtimes and filesystem separation to reduce host risk.
- SDKs for Python and TypeScript with programmatic control and integrations.
- Concurrency, persistence and OCI/Docker compatibility for flexible deployments.

## Use cases

- Safely execute AI-generated code snippets inside applications.
- Build sandboxed evaluation, automated testing, and learning environments.
- Support multi-user concurrent code execution and experimentation platforms.

## Technical details

- Monorepo with TypeScript, Go and Python components; provides SDKs and extensive docs at <https://www.daytona.io/docs>.
- Deployable via Docker/OCI; careful attention required due to AGPL-3.0 license on core repo for some components.
- Active project with frequent releases and an extensive contributor community.
