Paimon is a table format designed for realtime Lakehouse architectures, supporting unified streaming and batch workloads and integrating with engines like Flink and Spark. It offers transactional semantics, low-latency write paths, and optimized query performance for hybrid workloads.

## Key features

- Unified streaming and batch: Simplifies pipelines that require both real-time ingestion and analytical queries.
- Transactional guarantees: Supports versioning and atomic operations to ensure consistency.
- Multi-engine compatibility: Works with Flink, Spark and other ecosystem tools.
- Active community and documentation for production adoption.

## Use cases

- Real-time analytics: Serve as a storage layer for low-latency ingestion and consistent queries.
- Lakehouse modernization: Migrate data lakes to table formats that support streaming and batch workloads.

## Technical highlights

- Table-centric metadata and storage layout optimized for write amplification and read performance.
- Tooling for data migration and version management to ease operations.
