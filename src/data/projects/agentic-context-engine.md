## Overview

Agentic Context Engine (ACE), developed by Kayba AI, aims to provide agents with experience-driven context construction and management capabilities so they can learn and improve decision-making from past interactions and memories. ACE combines context-engineering methodology with composable components to improve agent performance and consistency in multi-step tasks and long-term memory scenarios.

## Key Features

- Experience-driven context construction: extract useful information from interactions and memories into reusable context fragments.
- Agent-focused API design: consistent integration patterns for single-agent and multi-agent scenarios.
- Scalable storage and retrieval strategies: support multiple persistence and querying methods to fit different data scales.
- MIT-licensed, enabling community reuse and extension.

## Use Cases

- Long-term tasks and multi-turn dialogues: retain and leverage historical context to improve long-term decision making.
- Agent learning and adaptation: use experience replay to enhance agent performance in dynamic environments.
- Task orchestration and tool invocation: combine context engineering to make tool usage and process management more reliable.

## Technical Highlights

- Implemented in Python for easy integration with existing LLM toolchains and extensibility.
- Modular components supporting retrieval, memory, and context representation at multiple levels.
- MIT license, suitable for research and production use.
