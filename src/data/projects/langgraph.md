- **Flow Control** - Flexible conditional branching and loops
- **Visual Debugging** - Graphical workflow visualization
- **Streaming** - Real-time streaming output support

## Core Concepts

### Graph Structure

- Nodes - Functions executing specific tasks
- Edges - Control flow between nodes
- State - Data passed between nodes

### Agent Patterns

- ReAct Agent - Reasoning and action loops
- Plan-and-Execute - Separated planning and execution
- Multi-Agent - Collaborative agent systems

## Applications

- Complex QA systems
- Automated workflows
- Code generation and debugging
- Data processing pipelines
- Customer service bots
