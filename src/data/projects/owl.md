## Introduction

OWL is a framework for building multi-agent collaboration systems, emphasizing task automation, parallel execution, and tool invocation. It supports a variety of toolkits such as browser automation, document parsing, and image/video processing, making it suitable for constructing complex agent-based applications and workflow automation scenarios.

## Key Features

- Multi-agent orchestration and parallel execution.
- Rich toolkits (search, browser, document processing, code execution, etc.).
- Extensible model backends and multimodal support.

## Use Cases

- Automated workflows and assistant systems.
- Research and development of multi-agent collaboration strategies.
- Building task-oriented agents with tool invocation capabilities.

## Technical Highlights

- Primarily implemented in Python, supporting Gradio/Web UI and local deployment.
- Focus on privacy and local operation options, with support for Docker and virtual environment installation.
