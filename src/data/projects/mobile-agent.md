## Detailed Introduction

Mobile-Agent is a cross-platform GUI agent family developed by Tongyi Lab / Alibaba, providing multimodal perception, planning and execution for desktop and mobile GUI automation. It emphasizes robust GUI understanding and end-to-end operation capabilities.

## Main Features

- Vision-based GUI perception and element localization.
- Multimodal policies combining text and vision for planning and action.
- Cross-platform demos and research components for PC and mobile.
- A series of subprojects and academic papers supporting the framework.

## Use Cases

Use cases include GUI automation testing, desktop/mobile operation automation, repeatable demo tasks (e.g., form filling, scripted interactions), and academic evaluation of interactive agents.

## Technical Features

The project integrates perception, planning and execution, focusing on robust element recognition, multi-step recovery, and engineering practices that bridge research prototypes and deployable systems.
