## Introduction

OpenAI Agents (Python) is a lightweight, powerful SDK for building multi-agent workflows. It is provider-agnostic, supporting OpenAI APIs and 100+ other LLMs. The SDK includes tracing, sessions, handoffs, and guardrails to run observable, auditable agentic workflows in production.

## Key Features

- Agents with instructions, tools, guardrails and handoffs
- Handoffs: structured tool calls to pass control between agents
- Guardrails for input/output validation and safety
- Tracing: automatic run traces for debugging and analysis
- Sessions: built-in session memory with persistence options

## Use Cases

- Building collaborative multi-agent systems and orchestrations
- Running auditable agent workflows in production with tracing
- Long-running workflows and human-in-the-loop flows (Temporal integration)

## Technical Highlights

- Pure Python SDK with extensive examples and MkDocs documentation
- Supports structured outputs and integrates with many tracing backends
- Designed for extensibility and real-world deployment patterns
