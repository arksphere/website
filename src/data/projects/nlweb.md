NLWeb is an open-source collection of protocols and reference implementations for building conversational interfaces for websites. It exposes site content as structured Schema.org responses and includes server implementations, ingestion tools, sample UIs, and connectors for vector stores and LLMs to enable production-ready conversational endpoints.

## Key Features

- Protocol and reference implementations for natural language access to website data.
- Broad compatibility with vector stores (Qdrant, Milvus, Elasticsearch) and LLM backends.
- Deployment examples for Docker and Azure, plus automation scripts.
- Community-driven docs, examples, and localization support.

## Use Cases

- Add conversational search and recommendation interfaces to e-commerce and content sites.
- Prototype RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) frontends using real website data.
- Expose structured website content for agent consumption and interoperability.

## Technical Highlights

- Lightweight Python implementation with multi-platform deployment options.
- Rich ingestion scripts and connectors for diverse data sources and vector backends.
- Designed around MCP/A2A standards for easier multi-agent integration.

Note: This is a concise overview—see the repository docs for full examples and deployment guides.
