Spring AI is an application framework for AI engineering that integrates AI capabilities into the Spring ecosystem. It offers provider adapters for major model vendors, integrations with vector databases, and production-focused observability and testing tools to make AI development in Java applications more robust and portable.

## Key features

- Portable model abstractions: A unified API for multiple model providers to enable swapping implementations.
- Vector store and retrieval integration: Built-in compatibility layers for RAG scenarios.
- Observability and testing: Tools for evaluation, monitoring, and integration testing in enterprise systems.
- Spring Boot integration: Starters and auto-configuration for easy adoption.

## Use cases

- Enterprise AI features: Embed AI into existing Spring apps for intelligent assistants, search, and automation.
- Data engineering and RAG: Build retrieval augmented systems on top of enterprise data stores.
- Model governance and testing: Integrate model evaluation into CI/CD pipelines.

## Technical highlights

- Built on Java and Spring, leveraging familiar configuration and dependency management.
- Comprehensive documentation and examples for cloud and on-prem deployment.
