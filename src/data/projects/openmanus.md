## Detailed Introduction

OpenManus is a modular open-source agent framework that helps move natural-language driven agent prototypes into deployable engineering systems. The project provides runnable examples, web demos, and multiple run modes (e.g., `run_flow`, `run_mcp`) and supports configuring different LLM providers and local runtimes.

## Main Features

- Modular architecture: pluggable Agents, toolsets, and workflow engines for flexible composition and extension.
- Multiple run modes: support for single-run execution, MCP tool integration, and multi-agent coordination via `run_flow`.
- Rich examples and demos: includes a Hugging Face space demo and example projects for quick validation.
- Community and governance: active open-source community, MIT license, and broad contributor base.

## Use Cases

Suitable for prototype validation, agent orchestration experiments, automated workflows, and integrating multimodal/LLM capabilities into existing engineering systems. Teams commonly wire trained or fine-tuned models into OpenManus configurations to iterate quickly in production-like environments.

## Technical Features

- Support for multiple LLM configurations and browser automation tools, enabling integration with external APIs and local tools.
- Provides example scripts, containerized deployment options, and a Python package for reproducibility in development and CI.
- Uses modular protocols and configuration (e.g., MCP) to enable interoperability and permission isolation between tools.
- Active contributor ecosystem and multilingual documentation to accelerate onboarding.
