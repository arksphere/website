## Overview

EvoAgentX is an agent framework for research and engineering that supports evolutionary strategies and multi-agent collaboration, enabling developers to prototype scalable agent systems and validate experiments.

## Key features

- Support for multi-agent collaboration and communication models.
- Infrastructure for evolutionary algorithms and policy search.
- Modular components that allow swapping observation, decision, and learning modules.

## Use cases

- Research on multi-agent simulation and collaborative tasks.
- Control systems that require evolutionary or adaptive policy search.
- Rapid prototyping and reproducible experiments with agent frameworks.

## Technical highlights

- Open-source project hosted on GitHub, welcoming community contributions and self-hosted deployments.
- Modular architecture for easy integration of custom policies and environment adapters.
- Experimental logging and evaluation tools for performance comparison and reproducibility.
