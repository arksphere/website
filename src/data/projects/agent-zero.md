## Introduction

Agent Zero is an open-source, prompt-driven agent framework designed for extensibility and collaboration between agents. It provides persistent memory, tools for executing code and external commands, and support for multiple model providers to treat the computer as a practical tool.

## Key Features

- Multi-agent cooperation and hierarchical agent relationships.
- Persistent memory and document retrieval (RAG) to accelerate problem solving and knowledge reuse.
- Extensible instruments and tools that let users define custom capabilities and workflows.
- Flexible deployment with Dockerization and multi-provider model support.

## Use Cases

- Automating development and operations tasks, such as scripting, deployment, and troubleshooting.
- Data analysis workflows that combine retrieval, computation, and report generation.
- Content creation and research assistance by aggregating documents and producing summaries or plans.

## Technical Highlights

- Behavior is driven by editable prompt configurations; every system prompt is exposed for customization.
- Supports Python and JavaScript toolchains, browser agents, and local terminal execution.
- Modular architecture eases integration of new tools, external APIs, and third-party models.
