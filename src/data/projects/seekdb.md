## Detailed Introduction

SeekDB is an AI-native search database from OceanBase that unifies vector search, full-text search, and structured/semi-structured data storage in a single engine. It enables hybrid search and in-database AI workflows, offering a production-ready platform optimized for low-latency, high-concurrency retrieval while remaining compatible with relational queries and analytics.

## Main Features

- Unified engine supporting both vector similarity search and structured queries, reducing data movement and consistency overhead.
- Columnar storage and JSON support for mixed OLTP/OLAP workloads.
- Production-grade scalability and fault tolerance suitable for enterprise deployment.
- Open-source (Apache-2.0) for easy integration and extension.

## Use Cases

Ideal for scenarios that combine vector search with traditional database capabilities: semantic search, knowledge-base Q&A, recommendation systems, and in-database model inference. SeekDB simplifies architecture and improves data consistency when products require full-text search, structured analytics, and vector similarity in one platform.

## Technical Characteristics

SeekDB combines columnar storage with vector indexes to deliver low-latency retrieval and high throughput while supporting transactional semantics and analytical queries. For integration and API details, see the project repository and official documentation on the GitHub page.
