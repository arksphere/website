## Overview

OpenSpec is a spec-driven platform designed for AI coding assistants. It enables teams to define machine-executable interaction specifications and tests, improving the reliability and verifiability of generated code. OpenSpec fits into development and CI workflows to ensure assistant behavior matches expectations.

## Key features

- Spec-driven development: define deterministic, executable specifications for assistant behaviors to reduce output uncertainty.
- Validation & testing: built-in testing tools for automated assertions and regression checks in CI pipelines.
- Integration-friendly: toolchain support for embedding specifications into existing development workflows.

## Use cases

- Define and verify strict behavior for code generation and repair in CI.
- Benchmark and regression control across different model variants during development.
- Use specifications as part of governance and safety for enterprise-grade code assistants.

## Technical notes

- Implemented primarily in TypeScript with tooling that integrates into modern development stacks.
- Extensible specification formats and validators, suitable for both local and CI execution.
