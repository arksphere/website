Opik is an open-source platform developed by Comet for evaluating, monitoring and optimizing LLM-powered applications. It provides tracing, evaluation pipelines and dashboards to improve model quality and production observability.

## Key features

- End-to-end tracing: captures LLM calls, conversation context and agent activity at scale.
- Advanced evaluation: includes LLM-as-a-judge metrics, dataset-driven evaluations and CI integrations.
- Production monitoring & rules: online evaluation rules, feedback scoring and Guardrails for production reliability.

## Use cases

- Evaluating RAG chatbots and dialog systems during development and regression testing.
- Tracing and optimizing multi-step agents and code-assistant workflows.
- Monitoring token usage, response quality and anomalies in production with fast investigation tools.

## Technical notes

- SDKs & integrations: Python and TypeScript SDKs with integrations for LangChain, LlamaIndex, Autogen and others.
- Deployments: supports Comet.com cloud or self-hosted deployment (Docker Compose / Kubernetes) with example scripts.
- UI & automation: built-in dashboards, Prompt Playground, evaluation rules and Agent Optimizer components.
