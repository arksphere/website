## Introduction

AIO Sandbox is an all-in-one sandbox environment for AI agents and developers. It integrates a browser (with VNC/CDP), shell, file system, Jupyter, and a VSCode Server into a single container, enabling unified workflows where browser downloads, terminal commands, and file operations are immediately accessible across interfaces. The project aims to simplify development, testing, and demonstrations of multi-step agent workflows.

## Key features

- Unified filesystem that bridges browser and shell/file operations.
- Multiple access interfaces: browser, VSCode Server, terminal, and Jupyter.
- MCP-ready services (Browser, File, Shell, Markitdown) for tool-enabled agents.
- Secure sandboxing and containerized deployment options.

## Use cases

- Agent development and debugging for multi-step autonomous workflows.
- Educational demos and interactive tutorials with an IDE-like environment.
- Reproducible automation and integration tests inside a controlled container.
- Rapid prototyping with pre-configured Jupyter and browser tooling.

## Technical highlights

- Multi-component integration: preinstalled browser, code server, Jupyter, and MCP services.
- SDKs and examples for Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Go to accelerate integration.
- Flexible deployment: Docker, docker-compose, and Kubernetes support.
- Apache-2.0 licensed open-source project maintained by the Agent Infra team.
