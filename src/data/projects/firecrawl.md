Firecrawl is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown or structured data. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean data for each. No sitemap required. Empower your AI apps with clean data from any website.

Key Features:

- Advanced Scraping: Crawl entire websites with all accessible subpages
- Data Conversion: Transform web content into clean markdown or structured data
- No Sitemap Required: Automatically discover and crawl website content without a sitemap
- AI-Ready: Provides data in formats ready for LLM applications

This repository is in development, and we're still integrating custom modules into the mono repo. It's not fully ready for self-hosted deployment yet, but you can run it locally.
