## Overview

TileLang (tile-lang) is a DSL designed for implementing high-performance operators (e.g., GEMM, FlashAttention) on GPUs and CPUs. Built on top of TVM, it provides concise Pythonic syntax and tooling for performance engineering.

## Key features

- Concise DSL and Python API for operator expression and layout annotations.
- Multi-backend support (CUDA, HIP, CPU) with device-specific optimizations and examples.
- Comprehensive examples and benchmark suites, including MLA decoding, FlashMLA and dequantize GEMM.

## Use cases

- Implementing and optimizing kernels for deep learning workloads.
- Performance tuning on cloud GPUs and accelerators (H100, A100, MI300X, etc.).
- Research and engineering workflows connecting high-level models to low-level, optimized kernels.

## Technical details

- Core implementation uses C++ and Python; relies on TVM for compilation and JIT workflows.
- Offers source build instructions, pip packages and nightly builds for quick experimentation.
- Includes benchmark scripts and device-specific examples to reproduce reported performance results.
