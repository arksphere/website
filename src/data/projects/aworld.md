## Overview

AWorld is a runtime and training platform for large-scale multi-agent systems, focused on agent self-improvement and collaborative learning. The project exposes modules such as agents, runners, swarms, sandboxes, and tools, and supports high-concurrency execution, experience collection, reward-based training, and observability features suitable for both research and engineering use cases.

## Key Features

- Runtime and orchestration tailored for multi-agent systems (Swarm, Runners)
- Built-in training and evaluation pipelines supporting distributed training and reward optimization
- Rich tooling and environment integrations (code execution, search, browser automation, etc.)
- MCP support and multi-model integration for diverse LLM providers
- Comprehensive examples and documentation including Quickstart, architecture, and application cases

## Use Cases

Suitable for academic research, industrial-scale multi-agent training and simulation, algorithm validation, and product prototyping for collaborative agent systems. It can be used to build autonomous agent workflows or as a platform to optimize adaptive strategies and collective intelligence.

## Technical Highlights

Primarily implemented in Python, AWorld features modular design, pluggable tool interfaces, a traceable observability system, and flexible policy configuration across multiple models. The project provides well-documented examples to accelerate adoption and extension.
