Agno is more than a framework — it's a unified platform for intelligent agents designed to build the next generation of AI applications. It supports multimodal and multi-agent systems, integrates over 23 model providers and more than 20 vector stores, and provides flexible routing and priority mechanisms that give developers unprecedented agility and choice.

## Model-agnostic design

Agno adopts a model-agnostic architecture that lets developers freely choose and switch between different AI model providers without changing core business logic. This approach reduces vendor lock-in and enables teams to select the most cost- and performance-efficient models for their needs.

## Priority-aware routing

The platform is built around a priority-aware routing design that optimizes AI-driven tasks end-to-end. From storage management to compute routing, each stage is carefully designed to ensure intelligent systems can efficiently handle complex processing workflows and deliver enterprise-grade reliability.

## Multimodal input/output

Agno natively supports multimodal inputs and outputs, including text, images, and audio. This comprehensive multimodal support lets developers create richer, more natural user interactions and meet the demands of modern AI applications.

## Collaborative multi-agent workflows

The platform supports persistent shared memory and context between agents, enabling true multi-agent collaboration. Agents can exchange information seamlessly and coordinate to solve complex tasks, expanding the capabilities of individual agents and enabling the construction of large-scale intelligent systems.
